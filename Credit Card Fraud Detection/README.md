**Credit Card Fraud Detection**

**Overview**

This project aims to develop a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to detect anomalies or classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, even with imbalanced datasets. This system helps financial institutions minimize losses caused by fraud and ensures transaction security for users.

**Features**

  ● Preprocessing of credit card transaction data.
  
  ● Handling imbalanced datasets using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling.
  
  ● Implementation of anomaly detection and supervised learning models.
  
  ● Evaluation of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
  ● Visualization of fraud detection results.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project includes anonymized credit card transactions and their labels (fraudulent or legitimate).

● Dataset Characteristics:

    ● Contains numerical features transformed via PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
    
    ● Imbalanced data with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions.
    
    ● Publicly available dataset (e.g., Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection).

**Technologies Used**

● Python: For implementation and data processing.

● Libraries:

  ● NumPy, Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis.
  
  ● Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization.
  
  ● Scikit-learn – Model training and evaluation.
  
  ● Imbalanced-learn – Techniques for handling imbalanced datasets.
  
● Machine Learning Algorithms:

      ● Logistic Regression
      
      ● Random Forest
      
      ● Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM)
      
      ● Isolation Forest (for anomaly detection)

**Approach**
1. Data Preprocessing:
   
  ● Handle missing values (if any).
  
  ● Normalize and scale the data.
  
  ● Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   
  ● Analyze the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
  
  ● Visualize correlations between features.

3. Model Development:
   
  ● Implement anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest) to identify outliers.
  
  ● Train supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to classify transactions.

4. Model Evaluation:
   
  ● Use cross-validation to validate the models.
  
  ● Evaluate performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and the F1-score.

**Results**

  ● High recall achieved for fraudulent transactions, ensuring most fraud cases are detected.
  
  ● Low false-positive rate to minimize unnecessary flags on legitimate transactions.
  
  ● Visualizations of model performance (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve)
